# Iota Phi

The [Iota Phi] website has been in existence since 2004 and many web masters have added to the site's functionality.  Phuc Le began working on the site in 2016 and converted the front end to be more mobile-friendly and responsive.  At this time, Git was also introduced as a version control system.

The site is mainly built with PHP and incorporates WordPress for easier use by non-technical administrative users.  Pure JavaScript along with jQuery and Bootstrap are employed on the front end.

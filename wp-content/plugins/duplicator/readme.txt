= Overview =
Duplicator enables you to:

* Move a site between domains or hosts
* Pull down a live site to localhost for development
* Manually back up a site
* Duplicate a live site to a staging area or vice versa
* Bundle up an entire WordPress site for easy reuse or distribution

= Move and Backup =
Duplicator creates a package that bundles all the site's plugins, themes, content, database and WordPress core files into a simple zip file called a package. This package can then be used to easily restore a site to any location you wish.  Move on the same server, across servers and pretty much any location a WordPress site can be hosted.

= Improve Your Workflow =
Duplicator can also eliminate repeat site configuration work if you have a favorite theme, set of plugins or content you install on all sites. Instead of manually configuring these over and over, with Duplicator you just need to configure a single site which you then bundle up into a package. From that point forward, you can install the package in different locations to instantly create pre-configured sites!  Web designers/developers can even create a package collection of the various starter sites they regularly install to save them setup time.

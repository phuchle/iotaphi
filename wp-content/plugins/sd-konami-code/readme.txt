== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the new Microsoft Edge browser supported? =

Yes. The Microsoft Edge browser should work fine.

= Why is sound not working on Internet Explorer 9 and lower? =

Browsers who doens't support HTML5, can't play sound. So Internet Explorer 9 and lower is not supported.

= Which types of sound files are supported? =

Most of the browsers support MP3 files, some browsers support also OGG and WAV files. But we did not test OGG and WAV files yet, so we recommend to use MP3 files.

Easily add an easter egg hunt to your site. Easy, simple and fun.

== Description ==

Using EasterWebs.com you can now create a web easter egg hunt on your site with a few clicks. The prize
for finding the easter egg can be one of your products, a gift voucher or anything you 
decide! You can even connect the egg hunt to your site's content, making it more engaging 
and adding a unique angle to it. 

So what is it all about?

Instead of having another boring prize draw, why not make it fun and create an easter egg hunt
on your site, no development necessary, only a few clicks and we'll do the hard work for you! And it doesn't even have 
to be Easter to give it a go! 

You create the egg on <a href="http://www.easterwebs.com/">EasterWebs.com</a> follow the instructions to enter the egg id into the plugin and the egg appears on your site. Your 
visitors follow the clues, then enter the answers as a series of key-strokes, clicking on a link, or by certain words appearing on the page. 

Clues can be created around the content of the site e.g. "My favourite site is EasterWebs", to 
encourage people to read your content. The clues can be easy or devilishly difficult depending 
on how you feel! Clues can be tied to external Twitter or Facebook content. You can use our eggs however you like. 

The first person to correctly follow the trail claims the prize either on our site, or, if 
you subscribe, your own page. The prize can be an Amazon voucher which we look after, a video 
on Youtube or Vimeo or, if you subscribe, whatever you want, including discount vouchers valid on your own site.

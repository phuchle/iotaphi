<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Entering The Game </b> </font> </center>
<br>
All players must register by 11:59 PM on Wednesday, May 18, 2016. You must have your real address (<b>I should be able to look it up on Google Maps</b>) listed on the roster to play. The game will start promptly at 12:00 AM on Thursday, May 19th, 2016. Entry is FREE, but we are accepting donations to cover the cost of the banquet ticket.
<br>
<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Prize </b> </font> </center>
<br>
<center> 1 Free S2K16 Banquet Ticket! </center><center>(If you bought your ticket already, we’ll reimburse you.) </center>
<br>
<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Weapons and Killing </b> </font> </center>
<br>

<center>There are very strict restrictions on weapons. If you use an illegal weapon, you will be removed from the game. And possibly punished by the God Squad. </center>
<br>
Allowed Weapons:<br>
1. Nerf Gun with one bullet
	<br>
2. Homemade Weapons - Some examples of past weapons are throwing knives, ninja stars, nunchucks, whips/flails, daggers, staffs, wands, snowballs, and even <b>dildos</b> (for the brave). 
(<b>They must still match the size requirements of other weapons</b>). 

<br>
<br>
i) Your weapon must be at least 6 inches long. There is no max length or width. Parts of your weapon can be narrower than 2 inches, as long as some part of it is at least two inches.
It must be constructed from both cardboard and duct tape, and nothing but cardboard and duct tape. However, your weapon does not need to be completely covered in duct tape, as long as it is somehow used in the construction. No other fillers are allowed to increase the strength or weight of your weapon. (<b>No plastic, pennies, metal objects etc. for safety reasons!</b>) You cannot use paper instead of cardboard or other kinds of tape. Decorating your weapon is allowed.<br>
ii) You can have as many weapons as you want, but any dropped weapons can be used against you.
<br>
iii) All weapons are considered poisoned, and one touch to any part of the body is considered instant death. (You simply have to touch your weapon to your target.) Weapons can pass through clothing, but not through backpacks or similar items. You cannot use shields of any type (<b>including books, backpacks, people, etc.</b>) to block or deflect attacks, but you can block attacks with your own weapons, dodge attacks, or hide behind things that were already there.

<br>
<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Legal Kills </b> </font> </center>
i) The target assigned to the player.<br>
ii) Killing your target while they attempt to kill you<br>
iii) In the event that the player finds out who their assassin is, they may perform a pre-emptive <b>self-defense kill. (Accidentally or purposely killing another player who is not your target who turns out, coincidentally, to have been your killer without prior knowledge is NOT a legal kill.)</b>
<br>

<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Targets </b> </font> </center>


The website will assign you a random codename, codeword, and target. Memorize your codeword! You must give your codeword to your killer immediately upon being killed so they can get credit for it. Upon killing your target or your killer, enter their codeword into the website for credit and a new target.
Targets are randomly chosen by the website, but assassins with more kills have a slightly better chance of not getting targeted.
Because targets are randomly assigned, there could be zero or more than one killer coming after you. There could also be zero or more than one killer going after your target. Check your target regularly to make sure someone else has not killed him or her first.
<br>

<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Safe Zones</b> </font> </center>
<br>

Safe Zones are designated areas where a player cannot be killed. This includes…
<br>COHO
<br>Dorms (<b>Room, Bathroom, and Kitchen ONLY.  Hallways, lounges, stairs, and elevators are not safe zones. </b>)
<br>Home and Apartments (<b> Including backyards and balconies.</b>)
<br>Classes (<b> Once you get out of class, you are no longer safe.</b> )
<br>Work/Internships
<br>Places of Worship
<br>APhiO General Meetings/Services/Events/Workshops/etc.
<br>Intramural Sport Games



<center> <font color="red"> NOTE: BY WEDNESDAY MAY 25 2016 11:59 PM THERE WILL NO LONGER BE ANY SAFE ZONES!! </center> </font>

<br>
<br>

You are safe:
<br>1. At service and going to and from service - defined as the moment you step out of your house to go to service until you enter the building of your choice after getting dropped off from service <br>
<br>2. At any APhiO events - defined as the location and times listed on the website calendar - there is no buffer for other events, so as soon as you leave the location, you can be killed. For example, if the event ends at 8 p.m. on the calendar, you can be killed at 8:01, even if the event is still in progress! <br>
<br>3. In a moving vehicle - defined as when the engine is running. However, buses are not safe, except for the bus driver.<br>

Private residences are semi-safe. You cannot sneak into someone's house or apartment without permission and kill him or her. This applies to any fenced off area, such as a backyard or a balcony. However, you can throw a weapon into a residence to make a kill.<br>

You cannot kill while you are safe. For example, if a target comes into your work, you are not allowed to kill him or her, even if you are on break.
<br>

<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Things Not To Do! </b> </font> </center>
<br>
1. Do not be stupid, do not do anything that would hurt yourself or others, and do not break the law.<br>
2. Do not harass other players or non-players. Harassment can come in many forms, but the most common is threatening people who are not your target. Harassment cases will be judged by severity and may be punished by a verbal warning, a visit from God Squad, and/or having your name written in God's Deathnote (<b>which equals instant death</b>). <br>
3. Do not damage or steal possessions or kidnap third parties in order to extort a kill. <br>
4. Do not cheat. This game is played on an honor based system. Play fair and play by the rules.  Any cheating or breaking of the rules will result in instant death.

<br>

<center> <b> <font size ="2"> End of Game </b> </font> </center>
<br>


<br>i) The game will run until there is one assassin left alive.
<br>ii) IN THE EVENT THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE PEOPLE STANDING BY MAY 26TH 2016, ALL REMAINING ASSASSINS WILL MEET AT THE TOP OF THE MU PARKING STRUCTURE AT 7PM FOR A FREE-FOR- ALL DEATHMATCH. FAILURE TO ARRIVE AT 7PM SHARP WILL RESULT IN AUTOMATIC DEATH AND YOUR CHANCES AT A FREE BANQUET TICKET.

<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Advice On Staying Alive </b> </font> </center>

<br>1. Be Stealthy, Be Quick, Be Smart, Be Unpredictable, Be Alive!
<br>2. Information is key.  Keep your location, schedule, and target a secret at all times, and find out your target’s location, schedule, and potential killers.
<br>3. Know who your killers are before they get to you.
<br>4. Avoid public places as much as you can.
<br>5. Never stay too long at one place.
<br>6. Take different routes to class, work, home, etc.
<br>7 Exercise extreme caution on who you trust and how much information you disclose to them.  Working together with someone can be your salvation or your downfall.  It’s best if you work alone.
<br>8. If you do have support, let them be your eyes and ears on the field.
<br>9. Be wary of the relationships your target/killer has with other people (BFFs, Roommates, Housemates, Floormates, BBLBs, Line, Tri-Fam, ExComm, PlexComm, Class Terms, Pbros, Groupies, etc.).  Loyalties will be tested!
<br>10. Remember, there could only be one winner and one winner ALONE!

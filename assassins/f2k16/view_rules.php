<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Entering The Game </b> </font> </center>
<br>
All players must register by 11:59 PM on Sunday, November 6, 2016. Eligible participants must live in Davis or spend at least 4 hours on the UC Davis campus for 5 Days a week. You must have your real address (<b>I should be able to look it up on Google Maps</b>) listed on the roster to play. The game will start promptly at 12:00 AM on November 7, 2016. Entry is <b>FREE</b>.

<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Prize </b> </font> </center>
<br>
<center> 1 Free F2K16 Banquet Ticket! </center><center>(If you bought your ticket already, we’ll reimburse you.) </center>
<br>
<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Weapons and Killing </b> </font> </center>
<br>

<center>There are very strict restrictions on weapons. If you use an illegal weapon, you will be removed from the game. And possibly punished by the God Squad. </center>
<br>
Allowed Weapons:<br>
1. Nerf Gun with one bullet
	<br>
2. Homemade Weapons - Some examples of past weapons are throwing knives, ninja stars, nunchucks, whips/flails, daggers, staffs, wands, snowballs, and even <b>dildos</b> (for the brave). 
(<b>They must still match the size requirements of other weapons</b>). 

<br>
<br>
i) Your weapon must be at least 6 inches long. There is no max length or width. Parts of your weapon can be narrower than 2 inches, as long as some part of it is at least two inches.
It must be constructed from both cardboard and duct tape, and nothing but cardboard and duct tape. However, your weapon does not need to be completely covered in duct tape, as long as it is somehow used in the construction. No other fillers are allowed to increase the strength or weight of your weapon. (<b>No plastic, pennies, metal objects etc. for safety reasons!</b>) You cannot use paper instead of cardboard or other kinds of tape. Decorating your weapon is allowed.<br>
ii) You can have as many weapons as you want, but any dropped weapons can be used against you.
<br>  

iii) You cannot use shields of any type (<b>including homemade shields, books, backpacks, people, etc.</b>) to block or deflect attacks, but you can block attacks with your own weapons, dodge attacks, or hide behind fixed structures.



<br>
<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Performing Legal Kills </b> </font> </center>
i) The player must kill their target assigned to them with a legal weapon.<br>

ii) All weapons are considered poisoned, and one touch to any part of the body is considered instant death. (You simply have to touch your weapon to your target.) Weapons can pass through clothing, but not through backpacks or similar items.<br>
iii) In an event that the player finds out who their attacker is, they may perform a pre-emptive self-defense kill where the player is allowed to kill their attacker. (The player must have prior knowledge of their attacker to perform a legal kill.) <br>
iv) A legal kill must be made outside of a safe zone and outside the time frame of a grace period (See Grace Period section more information.)</b>
<br>



  
<br>

<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Assigning Targets and Revceiving Credit for Kills </b> </font> </center><br>

The Iota Phi Website will assign you a random codename, a code word, and a picture of the target. Memorize your code word! You must give your code word to your killer immediately upon being killed so they can get credit for it. Upon killing your target or your killer, ask for their code word and enter it into the website for credit.  The website will automatically assign the player a new target once the code has been entered. Targets are randomly chosen by the website, but assassins with more kills have a slightly better chance of not getting targeted. Because targets are randomly assigned, there could be zero or more than one killer coming after you. There could also be zero or more than one killer going after your target. Check your target regularly to make sure someone else has not killed them first. 


<br>

<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Safe Zones</b> </font> </center>
<br>

Safe Zones are designated areas where a player cannot be killed. This includes… <br>
- The COHO (UC Davis Coffee House)<br>
- Dorm Buildings (<b>These do not include the Dining Commons, Lecture Halls, Area Service Desk, Trudy’s,Crossroads, or the Junction</b>).<br>
- Home and Apartments (<b>Including backyards and balconies.</b>) <br>
- Classes (<b>Once you leave class, you are no longer safe.</b>) <br>
- Work and Internships <br>
- Places of Worship <br>
- Sanctioned Alpha Phi Omega General Meetings/Pledge Meetings/Services/Events/Workshops/etc. <br> 
- Intramural Sport Games <br>
- Shields Library <br>




<br>
<br>
<b>You are safe:</b> <br>
1. At a service event the moment you arrive at the service event.  You are given a grace period after the end of the service event (See Grace Period section for more information.)
<br>
2. At any Alpha Phi Omega Events - defined as the location and times listed on the website calendar.  You are given a grace period after the end of the event except SNR (See Grace Period section for more information.)
<br>
3. In a moving vehicle - defined as when the engine is running. 
However, buses are not safe, except for the bus driver.
<br>
You cannot kill while you are safe. For example, if a target comes into your work, you are not allowed to kill him or her, even if you are on break.
You are no longer safe once you leave a safe zone unless you have been granted a Grace Period (See Grace Period Section for more information.)
<br>

<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Grace Periods</b> </font> </center>
<br>

Grace periods are defined as a 5-minute immunity granted to players at the ending time of a specific event.  Grace Periods are granted to players for the following events: <br>
-   The ending time of a service event<br>
-   The ending time of an APO General Meeting (Usually after the Toast Song)<br>
-   The ending time of any APO Event except SNR (Sunday Night Relaxation)<br>
- 	The CoHo (defined as entering/exiting the building)<br>
Warning: Leaving an event early will forfeit your grace period! <br>
-	Taking out your weapon to attack someone will forfeit your grace period, and you will be vulnerable to attack!<br>


<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Things Not To Do! </b> </font> </center>
<br>

1. Don’t be stupid! Don’t do anything that would hurt yourself or others.
<br>2. Do not break the law.
<br>3. Do not harass other players or non-players. Harassment can come in many forms, but the most common is threatening people who are not your target. Harassment cases will be judged by severity and may be punished by a verbal warning, or automatic death
<br>4. Do not damage, steal possessions, or kidnap third parties in order to extort a kill. 
<br>5. Do not cheat. This game is played on an honor based system. Play fair and play by the rules. Any cheating or breaking of the rules will result in instant death.

<br>
<center> <b> <font size ="2"> Advice On Staying Alive </b> </font> </center>

<br><center>Trust No one…</center><br><br>



<!-- <br>1. Be Stealthy, Be Quick, Be Smart, Be Unpredictable, Be Alive!
<br>2. Information is key.  Keep your location, schedule, and target a secret at all times, and find out your target’s location, schedule, and potential killers.
<br>3. Know who your killers are before they get to you.
<br>4. Avoid public places as much as you can.
<br>5. Never stay too long at one place.
<br>6. Take different routes to class, work, home, etc.
<br>7 Exercise extreme caution on who you trust and how much information you disclose to them.  Working together with someone can be your salvation or your downfall.  It’s best if you work alone.
<br>8. If you do have support, let them be your eyes and ears on the field.
<br>9. Be wary of the relationships your target/killer has with other people (BFFs, Roommates, Housemates, Floormates, BBLBs, Line, Tri-Fam, ExComm, PlexComm, Class Terms, Pbros, Groupies, etc.).  Loyalties will be tested!
<br>10. Remember, there could only be one winner and one winner ALONE! !-->
